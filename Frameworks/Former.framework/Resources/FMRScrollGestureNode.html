        <div class="patchTitle">Scroll Gesture</div>
        
        <p>The Scroll Gesture patch recognizes a scroll gesture and simulates inertial scrolling on a view. Upon recognizing that a scroll gesture has occurred, it will cancel all other interactions on the view and its subview (e.g. Recognizing when the user is trying to scroll a tappable button.)</p>

        <p>The Scroll Gesture can be used for scrolling content that will not fit entirely on the screen or to let users drag the area of content that they want to display. The patch behaves like a Pan Interaction with bounds and inertial scroll upon release. Users can scroll with drag or flick gestures.</p>
