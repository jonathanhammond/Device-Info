        <div class="patchTitle">Simple Pan Toggle</div>
        
        <p>The Simple Pan Toggle patch recognizes a pan gesture, and toggles between two states when the gesture finishes. Upon recognizing that a pan gesture has occurred, it will cancel all other interactions on the view or its subviews. The simple variant of this patch takes care of automatically animating to the appropriate state.</p>

        <p>Pan Gestures are commonly used to recognize panning actions on top of views that already have interactions. (e.g. Recognizing when the user is trying to pan a tappable button.)</p>
