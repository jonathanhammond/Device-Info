        <p>The Simple Image Fit renders an image view that is the size of the parent view with whitespace to ensure the image is not clipped. It scales the image while respecting its aspect ratio. A common use case would be a full-sized image in which 100% of the image is visible. It is a group patch and can be entered and customized.</p>
